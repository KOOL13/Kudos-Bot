# Kudos-Bot
Official Kudos Bot That I Am Working On!
# Original Bot
I deleted the original bot, so I am afraid its not possible ot test it.
# Features
Aiming to be one of the best yet easy to understand bot, this bot has everything you need. Unlimited rr, ticketting panels, custom level rols and messages, unlimited tags which can be executed when the text contains a word, starts with a word or mentions someone, economy system with as many custom roles in role shop as you want, auto memes that post every 30 seconds and a lot more! Aiming to break ALL paywalls!
# Github
Lol, you're already viewing the github but here it is - https://github.com/Kudos-Official/Kudos-Bot
# Things To Do
Change your token, and everything under the comment "customize" and "EMOTES", for emotes, only put the emote name :)
Remember this all is in server.js
The servers that use the bot need to have an icon, or many commands wont respond
Add all custom emojis or get console errors and no response
# Credits
I've taken a hell lot of time to do this, hope credits are not stolen :3 
# Side Notes
Get a good host, 144 commands might give you a lot of lag :)
# Support
I deleted the original discord as well(along with the bot), however I test my bots here: https://discord.gg/6HE7CK2GrZ
